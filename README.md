Airbnb project
This is my full-stack project based on a clone of the Airbnb website. For my frontend I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
For storing data I have implemented MongoDB, and I have also implemented the use of MVC as well.
For the backend, I have implemented the use of Express.js and Node.js, EJS, and RESTful APIs.
